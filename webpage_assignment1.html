        <h2><u>Full stack</u></h2>
        <p>
            Full stack development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and deploying
            a complete web application from start to finish. It involves working with various technologies 
            and tools, including front-end web development, anf database development. Full stack development
            is a term used to describe a software engineer or developer who works with both the front and back
            end of a website or application. A full-stack developer is comfortable working with front-end and 
            back-end technologies that power a website or application.

        <h2><u>Front-end</u></h2>
        <p>
            Client software, lso known as a front end, is a type of software that interacts with users. It is responsible 
            for the graphical user interface(GUI) that users see and interact with. It allows users to access and use the 
            features and functions od the underlying software or system. Client software typically runs on a user's local 
            machine instead of being hosted on a remote server.<br>Several languages can be used for front-end development, 
            including HTML,CSS,and JavaScript. Each language has its strengths and weaknesses, so it's essential to choose 
            the correct language for the task.

        <h2><u>Back-end</u></h2>
        <p>
            Server software, also known as the back-end software, is responsible for managing and coordinating the activities
            of the server. It is responsible for ensuring that the server is up and running and that all the different server 
            components are functioning correctly. Server software also provides an interface for users to interact wit h the server and for 
            administrators to manage the server.<br>There are a variety of back-end languages that can be used to develop a website or application. 
            PHP,Java,Python, and Ruby are the most popular back-end languages. Each languages has its own stregths and weaknesses, so it's essential to choose the correct 
            language for the project.
